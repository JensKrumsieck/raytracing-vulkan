# Raytracing in Vulkan using C#

This code is part of a tutorial series which i am publishing on Medium. 
We will build a small raytracer, similar to the one from the famous ["Ray Tracing in One Weekend" series](https://raytracing.github.io/) however we will use Vulkan Compute Shaders to generate the images.

I choose to use the [Silk.NET Vulkan bindings](https://github.com/dotnet/Silk.NET) for this project.
